## Introduction

This is a project I made to show what I learned to do, I created the Front with React based on Javascript and the shopping cart using Redux. Through Sping Boot I created the Backend that connects via API calls to the MySQL database. I also created a fictitious but working link to pay through Paypal.
I won't go into a more detailed description as the project is relatively simple and above all I added many comments to the inter.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, Redux, CSS
- Backend: Java, Springboot, Maven
- Database: MySQL

## Installation:

### Frontend

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.

### Back end

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project: `mvn clean install`.
3. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`.

## Docker:

1. Install Docker
2. Run your app with Compose: Navigate to your project directory and run `docker-compose up`.\*

\*The frontend image works perfectly, the other two need to be fixed, however I inserted Docker because it was my first attempt and this is a learning project.

## Usage

It is a normal E-commerce, with a cart and products divided by category, furthermore you can proceed with the fictitious payment with Paypal having on the same page also a contact details of what you have selected.
